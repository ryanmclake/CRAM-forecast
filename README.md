# CRAM-forecast
## Step 1 --> get the observed data and NOAA forecasts together
So far I have set up the NEON data pipeline within the NEON_data folder and the NOAA met forecasts within the NOAA_data folder. NEON data are directly pulled from NEON's website using the "neonstore" package while the NOAA forecasts are directly pulled from the Min.IO browser that is the source of the NOAA forecasts for the eco4cast challenge.
